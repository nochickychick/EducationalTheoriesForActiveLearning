  <h2 style="text-align: center;">Overview</h2>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An educational philosophy is a collection of beliefs and perspectives that have developed regarding education and learning as a whole.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Educational philosophies </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">inform and drive the various curricular choices made in regards to the design of learning activities and assessments. (Mann, 2011) They are the foundation on which educators build learning environments. An understanding of this foundation is necessary in order to build sound simulations and activities that facilitate student learning and meet course simulation objectives.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many major educational philosophies. As faculty, you may have come across several of them at some point in time. Perennialism, progressivism, essentialism, and critical theory (reconstructionism) are all major education philosophies that have had a lasting impact on education.</span></p>

<h2>Teacher-Centered vs Learner-Centered</h2>
<p>All philosophies will fall into one of two categories: teacher-centered, or learner-centered. 
    Some of these philosophies are focused on educators as the center of learning--for example, in essentialism, teachers are at the 
    center of the process. They hold the knowledge, they teach, and the student receives their teaching and makes meaning and learning 
    of it. In other philosophies, such as progressivism, the focus is on the development of the individual, driven by the individual. 
    The student is the active instrument at each level of their education. Progressivism&nbsp;is a learner-centered philosophy.</p>
<p>Below I have embedded a video of Kayla Delzer giving a TED<sup>x</sup> talk in 2015. While she is a 2<sup>nd</sup> grade teacher and talks about her experiences in her 2<sup>nd</sup> grade classroom, many of the points she makes can be applied to other learning environments&nbsp;as well. Think about what she says regarding the integration of technology and student-centered practices. As you go through the course, I suggest reflecting on how learner-centered concepts can be applied to simulation.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whenever we talk about educational philosophies and theories, it is important to&nbsp;keep in mind that they&nbsp;are not set in 
    stone. Philosophies change and grow, and are often replaced or supplemented with newer ideas. As the current social and cultural 
    environment changes and values shift we will see educational philosophies change as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Educators are expected to not only build on the foundation of existing philosophies, but to be part of the change and growth of 
    education over time. Educators expand the scope of the philosophies and look at education through different lenses to re-frame 
    curriculum design issues and address issues in curriculum and education.</p>
<p>Knowing what educational philosophies are supported and the learning theories that arise from them help us as educators to make 
    design decisions that ultimately will improve the learning environment for our students and help them to reach their educational 
    objectives.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</br>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Educational Theories</h2>
<p>There are two primary educational theories associated with simulation design and practice--behaviorism and constructivism. Behaviorism is most related to the traditional teaching paradigms many are familiar and comfortable with, while constructivism better represents the active, problem based learning seen in the simulation environment as a whole. Being familiar with both of these theories (and their related learning theories) allows us to better identify the parts of our teaching which are rooted in&nbsp;Behaviorism and are teacher-centered, and allows us to identify&nbsp;and choose methods which are more learner-centered instead.&nbsp;</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">Behaviorism</h3>
<p>When we talk about behaviorism, most people think of B.F. Skinner and Ivan Pavlov. Pavlov's dog experiment and Skinner's box are likely the most widely recognized behaviorist experiments.&nbsp;</p>
</p>
<p>As an educational theory, behaviorism states that learning is:</p>
<ul>
<li>observable by one's behavior</li>
<li>reinforced by response</li>
<li>teacher-centered</li>
<li>shaped by others&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<h3>Learning Theory Associated with Behaviorism</h3>
<h4>Social Cognitive Theory</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">The primary behaviorism-based learning theory referenced in relation to simulation is Social Cognitive Theory&nbsp;(sometimes also referred to as Social Learning Theory). Often attributed to Albert Bandura, a psychologist in the 1960's, SCT is based on the behaviorist idea that learning occurs when imitated behaviors are rewarded with positive reinforcement. Bandura built on this idea and added a social aspect to the idea of positive reinforcement by positing that students learn by observing and that changes in behavior were influenced by a student's perceived level of self-efficacy.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Constructivism</h3>
<p>Constructivism is a learner-centered, "active" learning theory. The learner constructs knowledge by building on previous experiences. In constructivism, "doing" becomes learning. The goals of constructivism include problem solving, critical thinking, and reflective use of information. In constructivism, self-awareness and reflection play a large part in constructing knowledge. Faculty's role in the constructivist approach is that of coach and facilitator, guiding the learner as he/she builds new knowledge.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Learning Theories Associated with Constructivism</h3>
<p>There are three main theories that are often discussed in relation to simulation: Experiential Learning Theory, Scaffolding Theory, and Situated Learning Theory. Overviews of these three theories are found below.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

    
    
<button class="accordion">Scaffolded Learning Theory</button>
<div class="panel">
   <p style="padding-left: 30px; text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">In the 1920s and 30s, Lev Vygotsky (a Russian psychologist) argued that learning was a social endeavor and that we construct learning through our interactions with those around us.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">He developed the concept of the ZPD--the zone of proximal development. This is often described as the area where a learner can almost function independently, but still requires some level of assistance. Vygotsky believed that if a learner&rsquo;s educational experiences and tasks were situated within this zone it would maximize individual learning. Furthermore, he believed that operating outside the zone was likely to lead to either frustration or boredom.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<iframe style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0BX2ynEqLL4" width="560" height="315" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>
<blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Vygotsky never had the chance to finish and expand on his work and writings--he died in Moscow of tuberculosis before he reached 40 years old. His ideas, however, were not left behind.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Later, in the 1970&rsquo;s Jerome Bruner and his colleagues, influenced by Vygotsky&rsquo;s ideas, coined the terminology &ldquo;scaffolding of learning&rdquo;. &nbsp;Bruner believed that students learn best in social environments where teachers support their learning by offering assistance until the the learner is confident and comfortable enough with the task to remove the support (the removal of which usually happens slowly, much like construction scaffolding is removed slowly as the parts of the project are completed). &nbsp;In this process, the teacher minimizes the number of choices available so that the focus is on guided learning of a task or skill. This process requires an educator to know where their student is in the learning process, so that they know when to step in and guide as well as when to gradually step away as the student becomes more independent and confident.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">In the video below, Bruner speaks to his ideas of 'teaching to the future' and being open to build on possibilities.</p>

 <button class="accordion">Situated Learning Theory</button>
<div class="panel">
   <p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Lave and Wenger (1991)</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Lave and Wenger argued that learning was situational and centered in what Wenger later termed "communities of practice". They believed that in the process of becoming a community member new members learned through social immersion--a specific process they termed "legitimate peripheral participation".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The video below gives a brief generalized overview of the concept of situated learning:</p>

<button class="accordion">Experiential Learning Theory</button>
<div class="panel">  
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<iframe style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aF63HHVbpQ8" width="560" height="315" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Experiential Learning Theory was developed by David Kolb in the mid 1980's. Kolb stated that <span>&ldquo;Learning is the process whereby knowledge is created through the transformation of experience&rdquo; (Kolb, 1984, p. 38)&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Kolb represents experiential learning&nbsp;as a four stage cycle:&nbsp;<br /><br /></span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Concrete experience</span></li>
<li><span>Reflective Observation</span></li>
<li><span>Abstract Conceptualization</span></li>
<li><span>Active Experimentation<br /><br /></span></li>
</ol>
<p><span>ELT is a learner centered theory. In simulation, this is exhibited by how the student controls the direction in which a simulation progresses. While the outcomes and objectives of any given simulation are determined at a faculty/administrative level, the student alone controls their behaviors in the simulation. They make choices based on their level of knowledge and comfort, and those choices drive the outcomes and consequences within the simulations.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>We will look at ELT again, in more depth, in module 2.</p>
